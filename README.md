[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/359195e4-6832-4457-b67c-e79ddaf8c549/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/eclipsefdn-adoptium-v2/deploys)

This repository contains the source code for https://adoptium.net.

The main branch contains the source code necessary for development. The production website is hosted on Netlify which also supports pull request staging.

## How to develop locally

1.  Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-starter-bootstrap-5/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
